# Diamonds
Using Exploratory data analysis, Linear regression prediction, and Regression tree prediction to predict the price of a diamond

This notebook uses a Kaggle diamonds data set. The data set can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds

Note: To my knowledge there's no way for GitHub to render embedded HTML in notebooks, therefore, my plotly graphs will not show up within the notebook.
